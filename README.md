# ZombieShooter.ResolutionPatch
1280x720 (16:9) resolution patch for Zombie Shooter. Adjusts screens & HUD for said resolution.

### Why 1280x720?
Maps are simply not designed for any resolution with more than 768 pixels vertically, higher resolutions also
showcase a lot of behind the scenes work with scripts and enemies can be shot without them reacting. 1280x720
is the best resolution which allows 16:9 gameplay while maintaining the game design. Official Alien Shooter update also
uses it.

# Download
